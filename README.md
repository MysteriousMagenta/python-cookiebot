# python-cookiebot
A Selenium Bot that plays Cookie Clicker.  

# Current Features
The Bot can currently finish-ish the game.
It's not ready for the grandmapocalypse, due to no popping of Wrinklers or anything like that.
But, if you just set it to not buy "One Mind", it gets far!

# Planned Features
The next planned features are Grandmapocalypses and aiming for a target.
The season stuff is on the backburner until those actual seasons.

# Currently Working On
Currently working on Grandampocalypses, Wrinklers, etc...

# Request For The Reader
I currently use a pretty bad way of choosing the best thing to buy, and I was wondering if any of the people reading this knew of anything better than (cost-money)/mps.
