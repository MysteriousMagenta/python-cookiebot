# python-cookiebot
A small bot that plays Cookie Clicker.
Currently it can get pretty far, but it won't buy the grandmapocalypse just yet (that can be changed by just removing the upgrade from the do-not-buy list.)

# Future Features
1. Resetting, currently working on it
2. Christmas special! Gotta wait for christmas to implement this one...
3. Keeping track of achievements, and posisbly even saying "I want this!" and having the bot work on it.
4. Much more!
